# Apartment-List-Coding-Challenge
This is my solution to apartment list's coding challenge.

My result is 24074.

But if the last ME in the dictionary.txt is a typo, or should be ignord, then the answer is 24073

My program takes two cmd line arguments:
 * the first is the filename of dictionary text
 * the second is the word we are interested in
 
So, just use follwing commands in terminal then you can see the results, in a while :)
```shell
javac network_size.java
java network_size dictionary.txt LISTY
```
